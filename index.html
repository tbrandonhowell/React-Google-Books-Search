                                    Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Every day I learn. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.

                                    Let that brush dance around there and play. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.
                                    
                                    In this world, everything can be happy. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Just a little indication.
